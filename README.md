## My process

For this project I started with the structure of the cover letter, followed by the profile picture and the name, ending with the buttons and their respective style, to finish I added some changes that I had left pending

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
    <div class="buttons">
      <ul>
        <li><a href=""><button>GitHub</button></a></li>
        <li><a href=""><button>Frontend Mentor</button></a></li>
        <li><a href=""><button>LinkedIn</button></a></li>
        <li><a href=""><button>Twitter</button></a></li>
        <li><a href=""><button class="end">Instagram</button></a></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
```
```css
/*card*/
.card{
    margin-top: 5%;
    margin-bottom: 3%;
    padding-top: 50px;
    padding-bottom: 30px;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 12%);
    width: 400px;
    height: auto;
    display: grid;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    border-radius: 3%;
}
```
